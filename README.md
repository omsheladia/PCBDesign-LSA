# PCBDesign-LSA
Behind the Designing of the Line Sensing Array(L.S.A)

## Using kiCAD - Open Source Software
This repository contains hardware design files and datasheets for the Line Sensor Array. This project is still in development and is not ready for release yet.
Coming soon with a finalised touch.

## Features
* Detachable I.C. for easy project based modifications.
* Components can be proctured easily.
* Easy connections for output signals.
* Compact enough to fit into any project.
* Distinguished trace widths for Signal and Power Routes.
 
## Uses
* Obstacle detection on a clear path.
* Line Following.
* Distinguish Colours on a path.

## Components Used
